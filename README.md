debugger.lua
=

A simple, highly embedabble CLI debugger for Lua 5.x, and LuaJIT 2.0.

Have you ever been working on an embedded Lua project and found yourself in need of a debugger? The lua-users wiki lists a [number of them](http://lua-users.org/wiki/DebuggingLuaCode). While clidebugger was closest to what I wanted, I ran into several compatibility issues. The rest of them are very large libraries that require you to integrate socket libraries or other native libraries and such into your program. I just wanted something simple to integrate that would work through stdin/stdout. I also decided that it sounded fun to try and make my own.

Features
-

- Trivial to "install". Can be integrated as a single .lua _or_ .c file.
- The regular assortment of commands you'd expect from a debugger: continue, step, next, finish, print/eval expression, move up/down the stack, backtrace, print locals, inline help.
- Evaluate expressions and call functions interactively in the debugger with pretty printed output. Inspect locals, upvalues and globals. Even works with varargs <code>...</code> (Lua 5.2+ and LuaJIT only).
- Pretty printed output so you get <code>{1 = 3, "a" = 5}</code> instead of <code>table: 0x10010cfa0</code>
- Speed. The debugger hooks are only set when running the step/next/finish commands and shouldn't otherwise affect your program's performance.
- Conditional, assert-style breakpoints.
- Colored output and GNU readline support when possible.
- Easy to set it up to break on Lua's <code>assert()</code> or <code>error()</code> functions.
- <code>dbg.call()</code> works similar to <code>xpcall()</code> but starts the debugger when an error occurs.
- From the C API, <code>dbg_call()</code> works as a drop-in replacement for <code>lua_pcall()</code>.
- IO can easily be remapped to a socket or window by overwriting the <code>dbg.write()</code> and <code>dbg.read()</code> functions.
- Permissive MIT license.

How to Use it:
-

First of all, there is nothing to install. Just drop debugger.lua into your project and load it using <code>require()</code>. It couldn't be simpler. 

	local dbg = require("debugger")
	
	function foo()
		-- Calling dbg() will enter the debugger on the next executable line, right before it calls print().
		-- Once in the debugger, you will be able to step around and inspect things.
		dbg()
		print("Woo!")
		
		-- Maybe you only want to start the debugger on a certain condition.
		-- If you pass a value to dbg(), it works like an assert statement.
		-- The debugger only triggers if it's nil or false.
		dbg(5 == 5) -- Will be ignored
		
		print("Fooooo!")
	end
	
	foo()
	
	-- You can also wrap a chunk of code in a dbg.call() block.
	-- Any error that occurs will cause the debugger to attach.
	-- Then you can inspect the cause.
	-- (NOTE: dbg.call() expects a function that takes no parameters)
	dbg.call(function()
		-- Put some buggy code in here:
		local err1 = "foo" + 5
		local err2 = (nil).bar
	end)
	
	-- Lastly, you can override the standard Lua error() and assert() functions if you want:
	-- These variations will enter the debugger instead of aborting the program.
	-- dbg.call() is generally more useful though.
	local assert = dbg.assert
	local error = dbg.error

Super Simple C API:
-

debugger.lua can be easily integrated into an embedded project by including a single .c (and .h) file. First, you'll need to run `lua debugger.c.lua`. This generates debugger.c by inserting the lua code into a template .c file.

	int main(int argc, char **argv){
		lua_State *lua = luaL_newstate();
		luaL_openlibs(lua);
		
		// The 2nd parameter is the module name. (Ex: require("debugger") )
		// The 3rd parameter is the name of a global variable to bind it to, or NULL if you don't want one.
		// The last two are lua_CFunctions for overriding the I/O functions.
		// A NULL I/O function  means to use standard input or output respectively.
		dbg_setup(lua, "debugger", "dbg", NULL, NULL);
		
		// Load some lua code and prepare to call the MyBuggyFunction() defined below...
		
		// dbg_pcall() is called exactly like lua_pcall().
		// Although note that using a custom message handler disables the debugger.
		if(dbg_pcall(lua, nargs, nresults, 0)){
			fprintf(stderr, "Lua Error: %s\n", lua_tostring(lua, -1));
		}
	}

Now you can go nuts adding all sorts of bugs in your Lua code! When an error occurs inside `dbg_call()` it will automatically load, and connect the debugger on the line of the crash.

	function MyBuggyFunction()
		-- You can either load the debugger module the usual way using the module name passed to dbg_setup()...
		local enterTheDebuggerREPL = require("debugger");
		enterTheDebuggerREPL()
		
		-- or if you defined a global name, you can use that instead. (highly recommended)
		dbg()
		
		-- When lua is invoked from dbg_pcall() using the default message handler (0),
		-- errors will cause the debugger to attach automatically! Nice!
		error()
		assert(false)
		(nil)[0]
	end

Debugger Commands:
-

If you have used other CLI debuggers, debugger.lua should present no surprises. All the commands are a single letter as writting a "real" command parser seemed like a waste of time. debugger.lua is simple, and there are only a small handful of commands anwyay.

	[return] - re-run last command
	c(ontinue) - contiue execution
	s(tep) - step forward by one line (into functions)
	n(ext) - step forward by one line (skipping over functions)
	p(rint) [expression] - execute the expression and print the result
	f(inish) - step forward until exiting the current function
	u(p) - move up the stack by one frame
	d(own) - move down the stack by one frame
	w(here) [line count] - print source code around the current line
	t(race) - print the stack trace
	l(ocals) - print the function arguments, locals and upvalues.
	h(elp) - print this message
	q(uit) - halt execution

If you've never used a CLI debugger before. Start a nice warm cozy fire, run tutorial.lua and open it up in your favorite editor so you can follow along.

Environment Variables:
-

Want to disable ANSI color support or disable GNU readline? Set the <code>DBG_NOCOLOR</code> and/or <code>DBG_NOREADLINE</code> environment variables.

Known Issues:
-

- Lua 5.1 lacks the API to access varargs. The workaround is to do something like <code>local args = {...}</code> and then use <code>unpack(args)</code> when you want to access them. In Lua 5.2+ and LuaJIT, you can simply use <code>...</code> in your expressions with the print command.
- You can't add breakpoints to a running program or remove them. Currently the only way to set them is by explicitly calling the <code>dbg()</code> function explicitly in your code. (This is sort of by design and sort of because it's difficult.)
- Different interpreters (and versions) print out different stack trace information.
- Tail calls are handled silghtly differently in different interpreters. You may find that 1.) stepping into a function that does nothing but a tail call steps you into the tail called function. 2.) The interpreter gives you the wrong name of a tail called function (watch the line numbers). 3.) Stepping out of a tail called function also steps out of the function that performed the tail call. Mostly this is never a problem, but it is a little confusing if you don't know what is going on.
- Coroutine support has not been tested extensively yet, and Lua vs. LuaJIT handle them differently anyway. -_-
